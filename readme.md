[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/mpppk/messagen/messagen?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/mpppk/messagen)

messagen is the tree-structured message generator with flexible constraints and declarative API.
You can use messagen as a CLI tool or golang library. 

## Installation
### CLI
Download from GitHub Releases.

### golang library
```bash
$ go get github.com/mpppk/messagen
```

## Getting Started

Think about a message that introducing someone else's name like `He is Liam Smith.` or `She is Emily Williams.`, and you want to change pronoun and first/last name randomly.
What about the following template?

```
{{.Pronoun}} is {{.FirstName}} {{.LastName}}.
# Pronoun is picked from ['He, 'She'] randomly.
# FirstName is picked from ['Liam', 'James', 'Emily', 'Charlotte', ...] randomly.
# LastName is picked from ['Smith', 'Williams', 'Brown'] randomly.
```

This template may work well but may generate inconsistent messages, because this message has one **constraints**.
If the pronoun is `He`, the first name must be masculine.
The same is true if the pronoun is `She`.

```
He is Liam Smith. # OK
She is Liam Smith. # NG because Liam is a masculine name
```

*messagen* is the tool for generating messages that satisfy the **constraints** between words by declarative API.
*messagen* determines messages that can be generated by a set of **definitions** that group together templates, constraints, and others.

Below is the **definitions** of *messagen* written in YAML.

```yaml
# intro.yaml
Definitions:
  - Type: Root
    Templates: ["{{.Pronoun}} is {{.FirstName}} {{.LastName}}."]
  - Type: Pronoun
    Templates: ["He", "She"]
  - Type: FirstName
    Templates: ["Liam", "James", "Benjamin"]
    Constraints: {"Pronoun": "He"}
  - Type: FirstName
    Templates: ["Emily", "Charlotte", "Sofia"]
    Constraints: {"Pronoun": "She"}
  - Type: LastName
    Templates: ["Smith", "Williams", "Brown"]
```

Then, execute *messagen* CLI.

```bash
$ messagen run -f intro.yaml
He is Liam Williams.
```

*messagen* always generates a consistent message.

**Type** is an identifier used for **definition** grouping.
Multiple definitions can have same **Type**.
**Definition** can be referenced by describing it as `{{.SomeType}}` in the template. If multiple definitions are found, one of them is picked at random. 
(In the golang library, this behavior can be controlled by `DefinitionPicker`. See [pickers section](https://github.com/mpppk/messagen#pickers).)
`Root` is a special type that is the starting point for message generation.

**Templates** is a set of templates used for message generation.
If a definition which have multiple templates is chosen, one of them is picked at random. (In the golang library, this behavior can be controlled by `TemplatePicker`. See [pickers section](https://github.com/mpppk/messagen#pickers))

**Constraints** is a key-value object that determines whether a **definition** is pickable. 
Key is a definition type. Value is a required definition value.

If template includes other definition types, messagen choose one of definition, then pick one of the templates, and these processes are repeated recursively.
In other words, the definitions can be regarded as having the tree structure.

In above example, there is only one Root Definition with one template (`"{{.Pronoun}} is {{.FirstName}} {{.LastName}}."`).
The template includes three definition types, `Pronoun`, `FirstName`, and `LastName`.
This can be represented as the following tree structure:

```
state: {}

Root:          ['{{.Pronoun}} is {{.FirstName}} {{.LastName}}.']
├── Pronoun:   ['He', 'She']
├── FirstName: ['Liam', 'Emily', ...]
└── LastName:  ['Smith', 'Williams', 'Brown']
```

By default, definition types are resolved in order from the beginning of template, so `Pronoun` is resolved first in this example.
If `She` is chosen as `Pronoun`, messagen state becomes as follows.

```
state: {Pronoun: She}

Root:          'She is {{.FirstName}} {{.LastName}}.'
├── Pronoun    ['He'] -- pick random --> 'She'
├── FirstName: ['Emily', 'Charlotte', 'Sofia'] (masculine name is dropped because unsatisfy constraints)
└── LastName:  ['Smith', 'Williams', 'Brown']
```

Next, `FirstName` is resolved. 

```
state: {Pronoun: She, FirstName: Emily}

Root:          'She is Emily {{.LastName}}.'
├── Pronoun    ['He'] 
├── FirstName: ['Charlotte', 'Sofia'] -- pick random --> 'Emily'
└── LastName:  ['Smith', 'Williams', 'Brown']
```

Last, `LastName` is resolved, and messagen return the generated message.

```
state: {Pronoun: She, FirstName: Emily, LastName: Smith}

Root:          'She is Emily Smith.'
├── Pronoun    ['He'] 
├── FirstName: ['Charlotte', 'Sofia'] 
└── LastName:  ['Williams', 'Brown'] -- pick random --> 'Smith'
```

```bash
$ messagen run -f intro.yaml 
She is Emily Smith.
```

You can provide initial state by `--state` flag.

```bash
$ messagen run -f intro.yaml --state Pronoun=Male
He is Liam Williams.
```

## golang sample 

messagen can be used not only as a CLI tool but also as a golang library.
Below is a sample of the previous definitions written in golang.

```go
func main() {
   // CLI tool randomly picks a template by default, but in golang, you must specify it explicitly.
   opt := &messagen.Option{
      TemplatePickers: []messagen.TemplatePicker{messagen.RandomTemplatePicker},
    }
   generator, _ := messagen.New(opt)
)

   definitions := []*messagen.Definition{
      {
         Type: "Root",
         Templates: []string{"{{.Pronoun}} is {{.FirstName}} {{.LastName}}."},
      },
      {
         Type:      "Pronoun",
         Templates: []string{"He", "She"},
      },
      {
         Type:        "FirstName",
         Templates:   []string{"Liam", "James", "Benjamin"},
         Constraints: map[string]string{"Pronoun": "He"},
      },
      {
         Type:        "FirstName",
         Templates:   []string{"Emily", "Charlotte", "Sofia"},
         Constraints: map[string]string{"Pronoun": "She"},
      },
      {
         Type:      "LastName",
         Templates: []string{"Smith", "Williams", "Brown"},
      },
   }

   // AddDefinition definitions to generator.
   generator.AddDefinition(definitions...)

   // Set random seed for pick definitions and templates.
   rand.Seed(0)
    
    initialState := map[string]string{"Pronoun": "She"}

   // Generate method generate message according to added definitions.
   // First argument represent definition Type of start point.
   // Second argument represent initial state.
    // Third argument represent num of messages.
   messages, _ := generator.Generate("Root", initialState, 1)
    fmt.Println(messages[0]) 
    // output:
    // She is Emily.
}
```

## Advanced tutorial
### Constraints Operator
Constraints Operator is a special operation to constraint the checking process.
It is expressed as symbols as a constraint key suffix, like `SomeKey?/`.

Here are available constraints operators list.

`?` operator means that this definition can be picked even if this constraint key does not exist.  
`+` operator is the same as `?`, but add constraint key and value to state if they do not exist.   
`!` operator means that this definition can be picked only if this constraint value is different from the value in the state.  
`/` operator means that this constraint value is evaluated as a regular expression.

### Constraints Priority
The constraint priority is the priority for specifying the definition selection order according to the satisfied constraints.
Constraint priority can be specified with colon and number in constraint key like `SomeKey:1`.
If there are multiple definitions with the same definition type, messagen preferentially picks up the definition with the highest priority.
The default priority is zero, so if the below definitions are provided, the first definition is always picked up because it has 1 constraint priority, and others have zero. If some definitions have the same priority, the order depends on the other definitions picker implementations.
 
```yaml
 # This definition is always picked 
 # because it has highest(1) constraint priority.
 - Type: Root
    Templates: ["a"]
    Constraints: {"Key:1": "Value"}

# This definition has constraints but any priority is not specified,
# so priority is zero.
 - Type: Root
    Templates: ["b"]
    Constraints: {"Key": "Value"}

# This definition has no constraint, so priority is zero. 
- Type: Root 
    Templates: ["c"]

# This definition has one constraint and has 1 priority, 
# but the state does not have OtherKey, so priority is zero.
 - Type: Root
    Templates: ["d"]
    Constraints: {"OtherKey?:1": "Value"}
```

```bash
$ messagen -f test.yaml --state Key=Value
```

### Definition Resolution Order
By default, the definition types which contained in a template are resolved in the order they appear. For example, in the template like `{{.A}} {{.B}} {{.C}}`, the resolution order is `A`,` B`, `C`.
You can change the order by set `Order` property to the definition like below.

```
Definitions:
  - Type: Root
    Templates: ["{{.A}} {{.B}} {{.C}} {{.D}}"]
    Order: ["B", "D"]
    # => definition types are picked up in the order of B, D, A, C
```

### Definition Weight
By default, if multiple definitions have the same type, one of the definitions is picked randomly. 
By using `Weight`, you can control the probability that a definition will be picked.  If `Weight` is omitted or a value less than or equal to 0 is specified, the weight is treated as 1.

In the below example, `normal message` has 1 weight, and `rare message` has 0.1 weight.
The probabilities that the definition will be picked are as follows:

`normal message` probability = 1 / (1 + 0.1) ≒ 90.9%

`rare message` probability = 0.1 / (1 + 0.1) ≒ 9.1%

```yaml
Definitions:
  - Type: Root
    Templates: ["normal message"]
  - Type: Root
    Templates: ["rare message"]
    Weight: 0.1
```

### Alias
Sometimes you may want to pick up multiple definitions from the same Type.

The following example will have duplicate adjectives because the same definition is always picked up from the same type.

```yaml
Definitions:
  - Type: Root
    Templates: ["messagen is a {{.Adjective}} and {{.Adjective}} message generator."]
  - Type: Adjective
    Templates: ["powerful", "user friendly", "minimal"]
```

```bash
$ messagen -f test.yaml
messagen is a powerful and powerful message generator.
```

By using an alias, you can retrieve different values from the same definition group.

```
Definitions:
  - Type: Root
    Templates: ["messagen is a {{.Adjective}} and {{.AnotherAdjective}} message generator."]
  - Type: Adjective
    Templates: ["powerful", "user friendly", "minimal"]
    Aliases:
      AnotherAdjective: {"Type": "Adjective", "AllowDuplicate": false}
```

```bash
$ messagen -f test.yaml
messagen is a minimal and powerful message generator.
```
